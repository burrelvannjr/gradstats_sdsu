### What is R?

We will be using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), an open-source statistical program. Open-source, of course, means that it is free to use. R is a programming language, and the basic R program runs through command-line. To make it easy on first-time users, we will also be  using R's graphical user interface, [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), that runs R in one of its windows -- without you having to open R. 

### Downloading & Installing R

1. Go to the [**R website**](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download the program. Under the "Download and Install R" section, select the distribution that matches your computer's operating system (macOS/OSX, Windows, Linux). 

    + For Mac Users: On the next page, under the "Files" section, select the first file/link (which should be something like "R-3.x.x.pkg")

    + For Windows Users: On the next page, select the link/word "base". On the following page, select the large link (which should be something like "Download R 3.x.x for Windows")

    + For Linux Users: On the next page, select your specific distribution, and follow the instructions.

2. For all users, install the downloaded R program.

### Downloading & Installing RStudio

1. Next, we will download [**RStudio**](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) which is a easily understandable user interface for using R. If you're using a machine (e.g. a non-tablet pc/mac), under "RStudio Desktop" click "Download". Next, it should take you to a page with a "Download" button. Additionaly, under "All Installers" you can select the RStudio download that matches your operating system.

2. After the download is complete, install the RStudio program.
